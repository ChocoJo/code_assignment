# Tretton37 - Code Assignment: Site displaying the colleagues of Tretton37

## Description
This is a website that displays the colleagues at Tretton37 where you can filter by name and office and change the way the cards are displayed.

### Build with:
Javascript, React as framework.
Bootstrap

## List of stories implemented & why they were choosen:
As a frontend developer I know how important it is that your application is compatible with different browsers. 
Therefor it is very common that a client demands that their product works without any issues in all kind of browsers(to my dismay, especially IE). That is why I decided to apply this feature and show that I am capable to do so.

One of the most important feature for an application is to have screen reader and keyboard only functionality. An application should be accessible and easy to use for everyone(In Sweden there is an EU directive for web accessibility).

An application should also be fast to use for the client. You should be able to find what you need instantly, that is why I decided to implement the filter functionality. This was also a way of testing myself and I came to realise filtering was harder to do than I expected.

Lastly, in order to make the application feel more alive I implemented some animation and also made it possible to switch between a list and a grid view. 

### I decided to use the following stories:
Keyboard only function
Fancy animations.
Responsive design, work on mobile and tablets.
Screen reader functionality.
Filter by name and office.
Enable switch between a grid and a list view.
Works in Chrome, Firefox & Edge.
Works in E11.

## Instructions to use the application:
1. Start by doing a git clone of the repository. 
2. Once you have a clone of said repository, run: npm install
3. When the installation is done, run the command:  npm start
